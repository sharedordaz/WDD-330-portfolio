        <h2>Error Handling</h2>
        <p>There are 3 types of errors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Caused by the system (in an external way)</li>
            <li>Caused by the programmer (like syntax errors or logical errors)</li>
            <li>Caused by the user (example the user enters a type of data that is not readable in the program)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>User and programmer errors are our responsability</p>
        <h3>How to manage them?</h3>
        <p>There are <b>Stack traces</b> and <b>warnings</b>. A <b>stack trace</b> is an inform of what is happening in your program. The console will raise a stack trace when a error ocurrs.</p>
        <p>If the error is not enoughly bad, and the program can still runs even with the problem, the console will raise a <b>warning</b></p>

        <h3>Strict mode</h3>
        <p>If you writte <code>'use strict';</code> at the start of your javascript file, you will enable the strict mode. This will make the console "to be more perfectionist" with your code, and raise errors easily</p>

        <h3>Create your own errors ðŸ˜ˆ</h3>
        <p>You can raise an error in your program if you write <code>throw Error("<i>write your error here</i>")</code></p>
        <h3>Try, catch and finally</h3>
        <p>As the same with python, javascript have try catch and finally to manage errors</p>
        <p><b>Try</b> is like an if statement, you put the snippet of code you want to check inside the try.</p>
        <p>In <b>catch</b>, you write a code that will execute when an error happens</p>
        <p><b>Finally</b> happens at the end of the catch or the try code, so it will run no matter if the code raise an error or not </p>
