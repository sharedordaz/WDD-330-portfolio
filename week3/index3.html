        <h1>What did i do this week</h1>
        <p>Made a website that uses javascript and a json file to show information about different topics</p>
        <a href="https://sharedordaz.github.io/museo-del-holocausto/" target="_blank"><button >Open site</button></a><br><br>
        <code>The site is shown in spanish, because im helping my mother, who is a teacher, with a project for her students.</code> <br><br>
        <h3>Thinks added</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Javascript program to show specific content only when a click event happens on an image</li>
            <li>Use the same logic to show only a limited amount of images on the page, and be able to show the rest of the content on different switchable "pages"</li>
            <li>Do an "X" symbol to hide the content shown and be able to show the content of other images</li>
            <li>Create an index selector for the content in the site</li>
            <li>Use media queries that adapt the site to all screen sizes, and detects if a smartphone or tablet is at portrait or landscape orientation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Readings</h2>
        <p>Readed about how to manage events like click, an when is better to use traditional or anonimous arrow functions. Something new i learned is how to use event.currentTarget (to refer to the item that is targeted in the item.addEventListener function)</p>
        <h3>This outide a class</h3>
        <p>You can use "this" outside a class. Alone, refers to the "global object" (the window). Inside an array, for example, it represents the whole array let. This is useful for refer to array elements within the array itself.</p>
        <h3>Objects</h3>
        <p>Studied about objects. Objects can contain assigned information, stored in pairs. For example:</p>
        <pre>let soda = {
    flavor:"root",
    brand:"A&W",
    presentation: "can"};</pre>
        <p>To access to a characteristic of that object, you can say the name of the variable and the name of the characteristic</p>
        <code>console.log(soda.flavor)</code>
        <p>It prints "root"</p>
